### PROJECT TITLE: Project Title

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to predict the enrolment of the upcoming Child and Youth Care  Program  students.

### Problem Statement

The CYC data is extracted from the college dataset .The aim of the dataset is to make a prediction of enrollments in different semester of year.

### Solution

The solution that I proposed is that I used different algorithms to  predict the number of enrollements in upcoming year. XGBoost is the supervised algorithm and it is the one which gives the high accuracy on our model.

### Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

data.csv: The dataset is of the CYC has 956 records and 34 columns.

app.py: In this i copied the code of my deployment model.

requirements.txt: In this I copied all requirements that I need to run the code.


### Getting Started
